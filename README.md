# blast-tools

## python-blast-imager.py

This is a python translation of blast-imager.pl, which was introduced in [BLAST](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/blast/0596002998/) I purchaced around 2008 and learned a lot from.  The code itself is not very compatible in current context since blast+ has taken over the legacy blast and setting up perl environment with GD would give some difficulties for those who are not very familiar with perl.

Although the web blast interface is very well designed and continuously improved with wonderful new features, local blast is still indispensable and result interpretation is always a key in post blast search.

The blast-imager.pl is a very useful tool to map HSPs over a query.  It summarizes not-very-perceptual result into a visual map.
